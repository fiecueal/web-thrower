# Web Thrower

Throw webs at things.

My first MC mod so starting with something simple.

Adds the Web Thrower, a bow-like weapon that places a web on hit.

TODO:
- shoot web instead of arrow
- place web on hit
- optimize shoot cooldown
- consume 2 strings per shot
- constant low damage per shot
- show web thrower on arm when held
